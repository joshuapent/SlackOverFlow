# SlackOverFlow

**Vision:**
The purpose of SlackOverFlow is to serve as a site for collaboration and learning for general assembly students. The vision for the website is to have two buckets: The first would be devided by cohorts, and would serve as a place for peers to ask one another questions and work through obstacles together. The second would be a more public forum for all students past and present to share more general coding issues that are currently plaguing them. The hope for this site is to create a more user-friendly experience for students to have their questions answered by people who know them, or have been in their shoes.

**User Stories:**  
-As a user, I want to be able to post issues and errors to a message board that other developers can access, wherein solutions can be shared and discussion can occur between users.  
-As a user, I want to be able to able to initiate a message board for my classroom to use privately, so errors can be organized by date and/or subject automatically.  
-As a user, I want to be able to start conversations about code globally or privately with ease.  
-As a user, I want to be able to earn Instructor permissions (special badge, administrative privileges) to differentiate instructors from students.  
-As a user, I want to be able to share images and/or embedded code blocks in my posts.

**Getting Started:**
Here is our Trello board, where we established our goals and to-do list: https://trello.com/b/hX4veedL/slackofferflow. 

Here is our Figma Wireframe, where we have drawn out a rough sketch of the site's appearance: https://www.figma.com/community/file/1223387614742251309

Here is our Lucidchart ERD, where we have designed our entity relationship diagram to plan for our database modeling: https://lucid.app/lucidchart/a5694843-7336-48c7-a710-6259a4ca2e25/edit?viewport_loc=44%2C-16%2C1227%2C877%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_b406949f-b786-499d-87b6-bad26823e76a
