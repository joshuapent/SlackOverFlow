# SlackOverFlow

**Vision:**
The purpose of SlackOverFlow is to serve as a site for collaboration and learning for general assembly students. The vision for the website is to have two buckets: The first would be devided by cohorts, and would serve as a place for peers to ask one another questions and work through obstacles together. The second would be a more public forum for all students past and present to share more general coding issues that are currently plaguing them. The hope for this site is to create a more user-friendly experience for students to have their questions answered by people who know them, or have been in their shoes.
